    "##### Scenario 1: Fraud Detection in a Bank #####\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a Junior Data Scientist at a financial institution. The bank is experiencing an increase in credit card fraud, where fraudulent transactions need to be detected in real-time. Traditional machine learning models, like logistic regression or a single decision tree, struggle to detect fraud because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fraud cases are rare (high class imbalance).\n",
    "- Fraud patterns evolve over time, making it difficult for static models to generalize.\n",
    "- A single model may not catch all fraudulent cases, leading to false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, your manager assigns you to create a predictive model via supervised learning. Given the challenges with detecting fraud you have decided to use an Adaptive Boosting model."
